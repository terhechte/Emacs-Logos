A couple of alternative Emacs Logos that I've created over the past months.

Installation (Mac OS X)
======================

In order to install them, simply open your Emacs.app (right click 'Show Package Contents'), head to the Resources folder, and replace the Emacs.icns in there.
You'll need to restart Emacs. You may even need to restart the Finder / the Dock.


Sourcecode
==========

The sources for these icons are included. I've creasted them in Blender 3D. Simply download the .blend file, and render them again, or modify them to your liking. The icons come straight out of Blender, no Photoshop involved.
